# Mobile Vision Prototype

This is a simple Android application to figure out how well the [Moble Vision API by Google](https://developers.google.com/vision/) works.

This app is self-contained. The images it uses are within the app in the `res/drawable` directory.

1. Clone from this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/arjunkrishnababu96/mobile-vision-prototype.git
```

2. Open the project downloaded above in Android Studio.
3. Run on an Android virtual device (ie., emulator).
