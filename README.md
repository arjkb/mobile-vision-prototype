# Mobile Vision Prototype

This is a simple Android application to figure out the effectiveness of the [Moble Vision API by Google.](https://developers.google.com/vision/)

This app is self-contained. The images it uses are in the `res/drawable` directory. As of now, there are two images, and the app is hardcoded to use one of them.

To run (works with Android Lollipop and higher only),

1. Clone this repository from the terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/arjunkrishnababu96/mobile-vision-prototype.git
```

2. Open the project downloaded above in Android Studio.
3. Run on an Android virtual device (ie., emulator).
